# Dev Workout - Code, Track, Measure your development effort

Code, track and measure your daily development effort.

## Setup your project for tracking

Dev Workout tracks project that use Git as a source code management platform. So to enable tracking first initialize your project git repository (local, github, gitlab or any other convenient to you).

Every project that has a git repository is ready to be tracked.

## Usage for Founders/Managers
1. Start tracking your project by joining us at the Founder's Assistant page:

[Founder's Assistant Panel](https://red-coast-08f276410.3.azurestaticapps.net/) @ https://red-coast-08f276410.3.azurestaticapps.net

2. Then add your project on the Onboarding page:
[Onboarding - add projects](https://red-coast-08f276410.3.azurestaticapps.net/onboarding.html)

3. For each of the developers involved in the project invite each of them as the participant to the project.
4. Send invitation codes to developers and ask them to download and install Dev Workout application on their computers.
5. See them joining your project on the Onboarding page status section

When configured properly you will see your project and team live performance on the [Team Overview - live](https://red-coast-08f276410.3.azurestaticapps.net/) page.
